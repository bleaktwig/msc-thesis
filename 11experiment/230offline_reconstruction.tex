% --+ CLARA +-------------------------------------------------------------------
    The CLAS12 reconstruction and analysis process is facilitated by a data-stream processing framework called CLARA.
    CLARA adopts a service-oriented architecture, allowing the construction of software applications using micro-services that are connected via data-stream pipes \cite{gyurgyan2016}.

    In this framework, each service plays a specific role.
    It receives input data, processes it according to its functionality, and produces output data.
    The input and output data are organised in tabular structures known as ``banks'', which are configured by the service developer to match the specific requirements of the service.

    The services within CLARA form a data-flow path, where the output of one service becomes the input for the next service in the sequence.
    This design enables a flexible and versatile data processing application, as each service can be individually improved or replaced without necessitating structural changes to the framework.

    To ensure consistency and modularity, the CLAS12 services are extensions of an abstract reconstruction engine.
    This engine provides common components such as initialisation and event processing methods, reducing the development complexity of individual micro-services and enforcing a uniform structure throughout the framework.

    By leveraging the CLARA framework, the CLAS12 experiment benefits from a modular and adaptable data processing pipeline, allowing for efficient reconstruction and analysis of the collected data.
    The service-oriented architecture and data-stream processing approach contribute to the flexibility, scalability, and maintainability of the CLAS12 software framework.

        The I/O service reads events from the input file and distributes them to the reconstruction services chain for processing.
        Each service reads the relevant banks, applies the reconstruction algorithm, and provides output banks that are passed to the next service in the chain.
        The Event Builder (EB) service is executed as last in the chain; it collects the relevant banks from all CLAS12 subsystems services and produces event, particle, and detector response banks that are written to the output file.

% --+ CLAS12 reconstruction +---------------------------------------------------
    The CLAS12 data reconstruction process involves data reader services that access decoded detector data stored in banks.
    Each entry in the bank represents a decoded detector hit and contains information such as sector, layer, component, order, and digitised data like signal charge, amplitude, time, or pedestal.

    During the decoding stage, similar bank structures are created for various quantities required for event reconstruction, including hits, clusters, and tracks.
    Reconstruction algorithms specific to each CLAS12 subsystem fill these banks.
    The data persistence service appends and writes these banks to a file for later analysis.

    The reconstruction algorithms are implemented as services that operate on input banks and produce output banks, which are then passed to subsequent algorithms in the reconstruction chain.
    The order in which the services are chained reflects the overall sequence of CLAS12 event reconstruction and the dependencies between subsystems.

    The first step is the reconstruction of charged particle tracks in the Central and Forward Detector tracking systems, based on the recorded hit positions in the respective detectors.
    This process is known as ``hit-based'' tracking.

    Simultaneously, hits recorded in other detectors are processed to reconstruct the energy and time of the associated particle interactions.
    The Event Builder (EB) service matches these reconstructed quantities with the tracks based on position and time information.
    Hits that are not matched to any track are retained as neutral particle candidates.
    The EB also determines the event ``start time'' and identifies the reconstructed particles.

    Once the event start time is determined, a second iteration of forward tracking, known as ``time-based'' tracking, can be performed.
    This iteration incorporates the drift times in the Drift Chambers, providing improved tracking precision \cite{ziegler2020}.

    An overview of the composition of reconstruction application services, depicting the dependencies between the services, can be found in Figure \ref{fig::recon_chain}.
