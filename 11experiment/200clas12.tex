        {The CLAS12 detector in the Hall B beamline.
        The electron beam enters from the right and impinges on the target located in the center of the solenoid magnet shown at the right (upstream) end of CLAS12.
        The FD consists of the High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC) (yellow), the torus magnet (grey), the Drift Chambers (DC) tracking system (light blue), and another set of Cherenkov counters (hidden), time-of-flight scintillation counters (brown), and Electromagnetic Calorimeters (ECs) (red).
        Between the HTCC and the torus, the Forward Tagger (FT) is installed.
        The Central Detector (CD) consists of the Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) (hidden), which is surrounded by a Barrel Micromesh Tracker (BMT) (hidden), the Central Time-of-Flight (FTOF) system, and the Central Neutron Detector (CND) (blue).
        At the upstream end, a Back Angle Neutron Detector (BAND) (red) is installed.}

    The main detector in Hall B is CLAS12, used to study electro-induced nuclear and hadronic reactions \cite{burkert2020}.
    The spectrometer provides efficient detection of charged and neutral particles over a large fraction of the full solid angle.

    CLAS12 is based on two superconducting magnets: a solenoid magnet and a 5 T torus magnet.
    The detector is divided into two parts: the Forward Detector (FD) and the Central Detector (CD).
    The FD, aided by the torus magnet, covers the forward polar range from $5\degree$ up to $35\degree$, while the CD, aided by the solenoid magnet, covers the polar angles from $35\degree$ to $125\degree$.
    Both detectors have full azimuthal coverage.

    Trajectory reconstruction is performed using Drift Chambers (DC) in the forward direction, achieving a momentum resolution of less than $1\%$.
    In the central detector, trajectory reconstruction is done using a vertex tracker, resulting in a momentum resolution of less than $3\%$.
    Particle identification relies on Cherenkov counters, time-of-flight scintillators, and electromagnetic calorimeters \cite{burkert2020}.
    Fast triggering and high data-acquisition rates enable operation at a luminosity of $10^{35} \text{ cm}^{-2}\text{ s}^{-1}$ \cite{burkert2020}.

    A diagram of CLAS12 showing the position of each detector component is provided in Figure \ref{fig::11.200::clas12_diagram}.
