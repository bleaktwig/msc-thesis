\paragraph{Alarm System}
    To ensure the reliable operation of the CLAS12 detector, all EPICS-controlled subsystems within it are equipped with PVs that define alarm conditions.
    These alarms, along with their severity, associated subsystems, and pre-defined instructions on how to respond to them, are displayed in a centralised alarm system.

    For each experiment conducted in Hall B involving a non-trivial target system, a specific set of alarms is required.
    In the case of the RG-E target, the list of implemented alarms and their corresponding PVs is provided in Table \ref{tab::11.313::alarms_pv}.

    \begin{table}[b!]
        \caption{Alarm names, triggers, and severities for the RG-E target slow control system.}
