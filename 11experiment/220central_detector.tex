\subsubsection{Central Detector}
\label{sssec::centraldetector}
    In the CLAS12 Central Detector (CD), particles scattered from the target within the polar angle range of $35\degree$ to $125\degree$ are detected.
    The CD consists of various detectors that provide particle identification and tracking capabilities.
    Charged particles are detected in the Central Vertex Tracker (CVT) and the Central Time-of-Flight (CTOF) detector.
    Neutron detection is provided by the Central Neutron Detector (CND), which is located radially outside of the CVT and the CTOF.
    All detectors have full coverage in the azimuthal angle.
