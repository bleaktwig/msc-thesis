\paragraph{Electromagnetic Calorimeters (ECAL)}
    The CLAS12 detector package uses the existing electromagnetic calorimeter (EC) of the CLAS detector, but adds to it a new pre-shower calorimeter (PCAL), which is installed upstream of the EC.
    Together, the PCAL and EC are referred to as the ECAL.
    The calorimeters in CLAS12 are used primarily for the identification and kinematical reconstruction of electrons, photons, and neutrons.

    The PCAL and EC are both sampling calorimeters consisting of six modules.
    Along the direction from the target, the EC consists of two parts, read out separately, called EC-inner (ECIN) and EC-outer (ECOU).
    They provide longitudinal sampling of electromagnetic showers, as well as of hadronic interactions to improve particle identification.
    Each module has a triangular shape with 54 (15/15/24, PCAL/ECIN/ECOU) layers of 1-cm-thick scintillators segmented into 4.5/10-cm (PCAL/EC) wide strips fitted between 2.2-mm-thick lead sheets.
    The total thickness corresponds to approximately 20.5 radiation lengths.
    Scintillator layers are grouped into three readout views with 5/5/8 PCAL/ECIN/ECOU layers per view, providing spatial resolutions of less than $2 ~\text{cm}$ for energy clusters.
    The light from each scintillator readout group is routed to the PMTs via flexible optical fibres \cite{asryan2020}.
