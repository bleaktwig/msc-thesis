\subsubsection{Forward Detector}
\label{sssec::forwarddetector}
    % The Forward Detector (FD) is an essential component of the CLAS12 spectrometer designed to detect particles scattered at small polar angles in the forward direction.
    % It consists of several subdetectors that play crucial roles in particle identification, tracking, and timing measurements.
    %
    % Based on its polar coverage, the FD can be divided into two: the Forward Tagger (FT) and the FD proper.
    % The former detects particles with a polar angle between $2.5\degree$ and $4.5\degree$.
    % The latter detects those with a polar angle between $5\degree$ and $35\degree$.
    % A detailed description of each subdetector systems is provided in the following paragraphs.
    %
    % The Forwards Micromegas Tracker (FMT) is part of the FD, but is not included in this list.
    % The detectors is explored in detail in Section \ref{ssec::forwardsmicromegastracker}.
