\section{Experiment} \label{sec::experiment}
    The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) is a High Energy Physics (HEP) laboratory located in Newport News, Virginia, USA.
    For simplicity and to follow convention, the laboratory will be called Jefferson Lab (JLab) hereafter.
    At the site resides a recirculating linear electron accelerator, named the Continuous Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF).
    This accelerator is capable a 12 GeV electron range to four experimental Halls simultaneously: Halls A, B, C, and D. % NOTE. CITATION PREFERRED, BUT MAYBE NOT NEEDED>

    Different physics are studied in each of these halls.
    This thesis aims to provide a preparatory study for the Run Group E (RG-E) experiment, which will occur at Hall B, where the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer for operation at 12 GeV (CLAS12) resides.

    The first section provides a short description of CEBAF at JLab.
    The second section then goes into detail about CLAS12, including its central detector, forward detector, and its offline event reconstruction.
    The third and last section talks about the RG-E experiment to be performed.
