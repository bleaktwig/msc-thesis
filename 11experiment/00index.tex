\section{Experiment}
\label{11::experiment}
    The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (TJNAF) is a High Energy Physics (HEP) laboratory located in Newport News, Virginia, USA.
    For simplicity and to follow convention, the laboratory will be called Jefferson Lab (JLab) hereafter.
    At the site, there is a recirculating linear electron accelerator named the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF).
    This accelerator is capable of delivering a 12 GeV electron beam to four experimental Halls simultaneously: Halls A, B, C, and D.

    Different physics topics are studied in each of these halls.
    This thesis aims to provide a preparatory study for the Run Group E (RG-E) experiment, which will take place in Hall B, where the CEBAF Large Acceptance Spectrometer for operation at 12 GeV (CLAS12) is located.

    The first section provides a brief description of CEBAF at JLab.
    The second section then provides detailed information about CLAS12, including its central detector, forward detector, and offline event reconstruction.
    The third and final section discusses the RG-E experiment to be performed.
