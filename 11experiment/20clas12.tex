        The electron beam enters from the right and impinges on the target located in the center of the solenoid magnet shown at the right (upstream) end of CLAS12.
        The FD consists of the High Threshold Cherenkov Counter (HTCC) (yellow), the torus magnet (grey), the DC tracking system (light blue), and another set of Cherenkov counters (hidden), time-of-flight scintillation counters (brown), and Electromagnetic Calorimeters (ECs) (red).
        Between the HTCC and the torus, the Forward Tagger (FT) is installed.
        The CD consists of the Silicon Vertex Tracker (SVT) (hidden), which is surrounded by a Barrel Micromesh Tracker (BMT) (hidden), the Central Time-of-Flight (FTOF) system, and the Central Neutron Detector (CND) (blue).
        At the upstream end, a Back Angle Neutron Detector (BAND) (red) is installed.

    The main detector in Hall B is CLAS12, and is used to study electro-induced nuclear and hadronic reactions.
    The spectrometer provides efficient detection of charged and neutral particles over a large fraction of the full solid angle.

    CLAS12 is based on two superconducting magnets: a solenoid magnet and a $5$ T torus magnet.
    The detector is separated into two detectors, the Forward Detector (FD) and the Central Detector (CD).
    FD, aided by the torus magnet, covers the forward polar range from $5\degree$ up to $35\degree$.
    CD, aided in turn by the solenoid magnet, covers the polar angles from $35\degree$ to $125\degree$.
    Both detectors have full azimuthal coverage.

    Trajectory reconstruction is done in the forward direction using Drift Chambers (DC) with a momentum resolution of $< 1\%$.
    In turn, in the central detector it is done by a vertex tracker, resulting in a momentum resolution of $< 3\%$.
    Cherenkov counters, time-of-flight scintillators, and electromagnetic calorimeters are used for particle identification.
    Fast triggering and high data-acquisition rates allow operation at a luminosity of $10^{35} \text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}$ \cite{burkert2020}.
