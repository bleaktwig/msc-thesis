\subsection{RG-E Experiment}
\label{11.300::rge_experiment}
    The RG-E experiment, to be conducted in Hall B, focuses on measuring the hadronic multiplicity ratio between various nuclei and deuterium.
    To achieve this, a double-target system is being constructed.
    This system will enable a precise comparison between a deuterium target and heavy solid targets such as carbon, aluminium, copper, tin, lead, and others.
    The primary objective of the experiment is to enhance our understanding of hadronisation in the nuclear medium, colour transparency, and nuclear short-range correlations.

    During the data acquisition process, both the cryo-target (deuterium) and a solid target will be exposed to the electron beam simultaneously.
    To minimize differences in acceptance corrections between the targets, efforts are made to maintain a minimal distance between them.
    However, it is crucial to ensure that the targets can still be differentiated during the reconstruction process.
    The work behind this thesis contributes to the experiment by improving the offline reconstruction methods prior to the actual experiment, with the aim of reducing the distance between the targets.
    Further details on this topic can be found in Section \ref{12::fmt_alignment_and_reconstruction}.

    Simultaneously positioning both targets in the beam allows for the cancellation of time-dependent systematic effects, thereby increasing the precision of the final results.
    These effects can include drifting gains and inefficient detector channels when measuring ratio-like observables.
    Since the target system will be placed in a vacuum, the switching between solid targets needs to be done remotely.
    It is essential to perform the switching quickly to maximise the beam time available for the experiment.

    The double target system is designed to enable switching between up to five different solid targets.
    Previous experiments, such as EG2 conducted on the former CLAS, have demonstrated that the design of the double target system offers significant advantages in reducing systematic uncertainties \cite{hakobyan2008}.
    The principle of the target system involves installing the solid targets on a carbon fibre band that slides on torlon rails.
    The movement of the band is accomplished using a piezo-motor, chosen for its insensitivity to magnetic fields.
    Figure \ref{fig::11.300::double_target} illustrates the proposed design of the double target system.

    To ensure the proper functioning of the target, a series of tests have been conducted.
    These tests cover various aspects of the target's operation and performance.
    They include:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Movement under vacuum and high magnetic field:
            The target system has been tested to ensure that it can operate smoothly and reliably under vacuum conditions and in the presence of high magnetic fields.
            This is important to verify that the target's movement and positioning are not affected by these conditions.

        \item
            Radiation hardness of selected materials:
            The materials used in the target system have been tested for their resistance to radiation.
            This is crucial because the target may be exposed to radiation during the experiment.
            By assessing the radiation hardness of the materials, it can be ensured that they will maintain their structural integrity and functionality throughout the experiment.

        \item
            Heat removal tests:
            The target system has undergone heat removal tests to ensure that it can effectively dissipate heat generated during operation.
            It is essential to keep the target temperature well below its melting point to prevent any damage or degradation.
            By conducting heat removal tests, the target's cooling capabilities have been evaluated to ensure optimal performance and longevity.
    \end{itemize}

    These tests collectively aim to validate the target's operational robustness and reliability under the specific conditions of the experiment, thereby ensuring accurate and consistent data collection.
