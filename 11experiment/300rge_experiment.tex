\subsection{RG-E Experiment} \label{ssec::rgeexperiment}
    The Run Group E (RG-E) experiment aims to measure the hadronic multiplicity ratio between different nuclei and deuterium.
    To do this, a double-target system is being built to be used in Hall B.
    The system will allow a precise comparison of a deuterium target and heavy solid targets, like carbon, aluminium, copper, tin, lead, etc.
    The experiment aims to further the understanding of hadronisation in the nuclear medium, colour transparency, and nuclear short-range correlations.

    During data acquisition, the cryo-target (deuterium) and a solid target will be exposed to the electron beam simultaneously.
    To minimise acceptance correction difference between targets, we aim to keep the distance between them as low as possible -- as long as we can differentiate between the targets in reconstruction.
    Part of this thesis' work involves improving offline reconstruction before the experiment to reduce this distance, which can be read in chapter \ref{sec::fmtalignmentandreconstruction}.

    Positioning both targets in the beam simultaneously allows us to cancel time-dependent systematic effects o increase the precision of final results.
    These include effects such as drifting gains and inefficient detector channels in the measurement of ratio-like observables.
    Then, since the target system will be in a vacuum, the switching between solid targets will need to be performed remotely.
    Additionally, it needs to be done as quickly as possible, to maximise the beam time of the experiment.

    The double target system will be able to switch between up to five different solid targets.
    The previous EG2 experiment performed on the former CLAS showed that the design of the double target system has significant advantages to reduce the systematic uncertainties \cite{hakobyan2008}.
    The principle of the target system is to have the solid targets installed on a carbon fibre band which slides on torlon rails.
    The band is moved by a piezo-motor, which -- like all other chosen materials -- is insensitive to magnetic fields.
    The design proposed can be seen in figure \ref{fig::double_target}.

    To ensure the adequate operation of the target, several tests were performed.
    These include movement under vacuum and high magnetic field, radiation hardness of the selected materials, and heat removal tests which secure that target remain far below melting point.
