\section{FMT Alignment and Reconstruction} \label{sec::fmtalignmentandreconstruction}
    In paper, the Forwards MicroMegas Tracker (FMT) offers a $3$ to $10$-fold increase in resolution when compared to the Drift Chambers (DC) \cite{aune2009}.
    Achieving this improvement requires work in the alignment and calibration of the detector, and the reconstruction from its data.
    This chapter concerns some of the work done in this endeavour, specifically concerning alignment and reconstruction.

    The first section offers a detailed description of MicroMegas detectors in general and the FMT in particular.
    Then, the second and third sections talk about the efforts done in alignment and reconstruction respectively.
    Finally, the improvement in resolution that results from this work is detailed in the fourth and final section of the chapter.
