\section{FMT Alignment and Reconstruction}
\label{sec::fmt_alignment_and_reconstruction}
    In paper, the Forwards Micromegas Tracker (FMT) offers a 3 to 10-fold increase in resolution when compared to DC \cite{aune2009}.
    Achieving this improvement requires work on the alignment and calibration of the detector, as well as the reconstruction from its data.
    This chapter focuses on the work carried out in this endeavor, specifically addressing alignment and reconstruction.

    The first section provides a detailed description of Micromegas detectors in general and the FMT in particular.
    Subsequently, the second and third sections discuss the efforts made in alignment and reconstruction, respectively.
    Finally, the fourth and final section of the chapter elaborates on the resolution improvement resulting from this work.
