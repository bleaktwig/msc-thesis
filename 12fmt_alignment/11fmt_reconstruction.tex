    After a signal is detected on a readout strip and the data is stored, information is obtained from it from offline reconstruction.
    Being a tracker, FMT's reconstruction works in a fairly similar manner to DC's.

    First, after a signal is detected in a strip it is digitised, processed, and turned into an \textbf{FMT Hit}.
    A group of FMT hits is processed via a \textbf{Cluster Finding} algorithm, where a \textbf{Cluster} is defined as a group of hits that supposedly come from the same particle track.
    A group of clusters from different layers go through a \textbf{DC Track Matching} algorithm, where they are matched to DC tracks from DC Reconstruction.
    A \textbf{Track Refitting} algorithm is applied for each DC track using the clusters' data, updating them to re-fitted tracks, named \textbf{FMT tracks}.
    This whole process is summarised in figure \ref{fig::fmt_recon}.
