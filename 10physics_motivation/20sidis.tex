\subsection{Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering}
\label{ssec::sidis}
    The previous section focused solely on the detection of the scattered electron in the inclusive reaction.
    However, in the case where one of the produced hadrons is identified, the event is referred to as semi-inclusive.
    The identification of this hadron provides information about the flavor of the quark that was struck.
    In Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS), it is possible to measure this flavor dependence.
    The identified hadrons in SIDIS are known as current fragments, and it is important to separate them in the analysis from the fragments originating from the target.
