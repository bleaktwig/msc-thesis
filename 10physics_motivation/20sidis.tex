\subsection{Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering}
\label{ssec::sidis}
    The previous section only considers the detection of the scattered electron in the inclusive reaction.
    If, in addition to this, \textit{one} of the produced hadrons is identified, the event is called semi-inclusive.
    This hadron carries information on the flavor of the struck quark.
    In Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS), this flavor dependence can be measured.
    These are called current fragments, and must be separated in analysis from the target fragments.
