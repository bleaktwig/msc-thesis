\subsubsection{Virtual Photon Absorption}
\label{10.31::virtual_photon_absorption}
    The first stage in the hadronisation process is the absorption of a virtual photon by a quark.
    This process occurs on a relatively short timescale, much less than 1 fm/c, and is governed by the wavelength of the virtual photon.

    During this stage, the virtual photon interacts with a quark, transferring energy and momentum to the quark.
    The quark undergoes a transition to a higher energy state, which initiates the subsequent stages of hadronisation.
