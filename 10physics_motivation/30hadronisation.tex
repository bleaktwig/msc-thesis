\subsection{Hadronisation in the Nuclear Medium}
\label{10.30::hadronisation_in_the_nuclear_medium}
    Hadronisation is the process in which quarks and gluons form hadrons.
    In the nuclear medium, this process is influenced by quark energy loss through two mediums: gluon radiation and multiple quark-nucleon scattering.
    Additionally, hadron-nucleon interactions also affect the process if hadronisation occurs inside the nucleus.

    The primary experimental observable in hadronisation is the multiplicity of hadrons produced in a dense nucleus compared to a light one, such as deuterium.
    In the absence of attenuation from interactions with the medium, these multiplicities should be identical, resulting in a ratio of unity.
    This ratio is known as the attenuation ratio and is defined as
    \begin{equation*}
        R^h_{\text{att}}(z,\nu) = \frac
            {\left( \frac{1}{\sigma} \frac{d^2\sigma(eN \rightarrow ehX)}{dzd\nu} \right)_A}
            {\left( \frac{1}{\sigma} \frac{d^2\sigma(eN \rightarrow ehX)}{dzd\nu} \right)_{\prescript{2}{}{H}}},
    \end{equation*}
    where the derivative with respect to $Q^2$ is substituted with one with respect to $\nu$.
    The $\nu$ and $z$ dependence of this ratio can be used to study the nature of the hadron formation mechanism.

    One type of observable that can be isolated is the characteristic times for the distinct stages of the hadronisation process.
    The existence of these stages is dictated by two fundamental properties in QCD: confinement and causality.
    Confinement implies that a coloured quark can only propagate for a limited distance.
    Causality dictates that the equilibrium colour field of a hadron cannot be formed instantaneously.
