\subsection{Deep Inelastic Scattering} \label{sec::dis}
% --+ Basic description +-------------------------------------------------------
    In its simplest description, DIS refers to the scattering of an electron off a quark inside a nucleon.
    Figure \ref{fig::dis_diagram} displays the Feynman diagram illustrating DIS.
    The four-momentum of the nucleon is denoted by $P$, while that of the quark is represented by $p$.
    The initial and final four-momenta of the electron are given by $k$ and $k'$, respectively.
    When $k'$ is measured, the momentum transferred to the hadron system by the virtual photon is defined as $q = k - k'$.
    $q$ is a spacelike vector conventionally denoted as $q^2 = -Q^2$.

    If $Q^2$ is sufficiently high, the quark is ejected from the nucleon.
    Soft processes, such as gluon emission and quark-antiquark pair production, then take place to neutralise the colour charge.
    This results in the transformation of the ejected quark into a jet of hadrons.
    The jet propagates in the direction of the transferred momentum from the electron.
