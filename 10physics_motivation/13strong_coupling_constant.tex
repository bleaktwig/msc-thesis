\subsubsection{Strong Coupling Constant $\alpha_s$}
\label{10.13::strong_coupling_constant}
    Measuring the experimental value of $\alpha_s$ is crucial for perturbative QCD calculations.
    To achieve this, the overall scale of renormalisation needs to be determined.
    Typically, the mass of the neutral Bose particle $Z^0$, which is $91.19$ GeV, is chosen as the scale.
    Furthermore, the renormalisation scheme should be fixed, which defines the coupling constant at a specific scale.
    The experimental results for $\alpha_s$ can be seen in Figure \ref{fig::10.13::alpha_q_dependence}.

        {Experimentally measured dependence of $\alpha_s$ on $Q$.
        The measured values are compared with the theoretical predictions of renormalised evolution with an initial value of $\alpha_s(m_z) = 0.117$ GeV.}
