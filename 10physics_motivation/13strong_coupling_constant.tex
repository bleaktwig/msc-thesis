\subsubsection{Strong Coupling Constant $\alpha_s$}
    Measuring the experimental value of $\alpha_s$ is important for perturbative QCD calculations.
    To do this, one should determine the overall scale of renormalisation.
    This is usually selected to be the mass of the neutral Bose particle $Z^0$, which is $91.19$ GeV.
    Additionally, one should fix the scheme of renormalisation, which defines the coupling constant in a given scale.
    The experimental results for $\alpha_s$ can be seen on figure
