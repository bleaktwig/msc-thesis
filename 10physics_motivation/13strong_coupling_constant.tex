\subsubsection{Strong Coupling Constant $\alpha_s$}
    Measuring the experimental value of $\alpha_s$ is crucial for perturbative QCD calculations.
    To achieve this, the overall scale of renormalization needs to be determined.
    Typically, the mass of the neutral Bose particle $Z^0$, which is $91.19$ GeV, is chosen as the scale.
    Furthermore, the renormalization scheme should be fixed, which defines the coupling constant at a specific scale.
    The experimental results for $\alpha_s$ can be seen in Figure \ref{fig::alpha_q_dependence}.
