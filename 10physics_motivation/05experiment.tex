% --+ What is this experiment +-------------------------------------------------
At a larger distance scale, or smaller resolution, confinement is expected to become visible.
The \textalpha value increases to values close to 1, and the perturbative treatment of QCD is not viable.
There is limited knowledge about the non-perturbative behaviour of QCD, and therefore, it mostly relies on phenomenological models at present.
The aim of the RG-E experiment is to gather new data on the hadronic structure in Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS).
Through this experiment, we hope to gain further insight into quark propagation and hadron formation.
