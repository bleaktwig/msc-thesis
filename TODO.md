## TODO
###### Milestones
* **07/19 - 07/21.** Simulate the RG-E target in the chosen region. Reconstruct and study behavior of DIS variables.
* **07/24 - 07/27.** Finish up thesis text.
* **07/27.** Freeze thesis. Allow commitee time to correct mistakes and provide feedback.
* **07/28 - 08/06.** *Days off due to marriage license.*
* **08/07 - 08/20.** Work on thesis defense presentation.
* **08/21 - 08/27.** Meet w/ Raffaella + RG-E group, show results and thesis defense so far. Apply feedback based on meeting.
* **08/28 - 09/13.** Work on thesis defense presentation and regularily present to commitee for feedback.
* **09/14.** Defend thesis.

###### Text
* Run a GEMC simulation to see how well the target behaves at the chosen location (-5 to 2 cm) in simulation.
* Finish up Section 14.33 with simulation stuff.
* Write Section 14.40.
    * Mention in Section that simulation cannot compensate for all efficiencies, and there's an unestimated systematic error of about 10%.
    * Check Raffaella's email about this systematic error and figure out approximated systematic error for my variables.
* *Add more information on the RG-F target?*

###### Defense
* Defense is scheduled for September 14th at 10 hrs.
* Scale vz bin plots to whole frame, improve legibility in general.

###### Miscellaneous
* Plan a meeting with Raffaella & the RG-E people for the week of August 21st.
* *Get a render of a track made with CED?*

## ChatGPT Proofreading Prompt
I need you to proofread my thesis. Here are some guidelines:
* The thesis should be written in British English.
* Focus on proofreading the syntax, ortography, and grammar in general.
* The document is a M.Sc. thesis in physics, so please tell me if I make some inconsistencies.
* Please, *never* mix expectations or suppositions with observations. That would invalidate the document in its entirety.
* I personally like short sentences, so feel free to separate longer ones as long as it doesn't damage the message.
* Never remove a citation or change its format.
* Please don't add a `:` before a formula.
All following prompts are exclusively going to be text to be proofread, so be sure to interpret all of them as that.
Please focus on not changing your behavior as prompts go on. Thanks!
