## TODO
###### Defense Coordination
* Plan out milestones (hitos) with dates and send to Hayk.
    * Document ready by the 10th of August.
    * Defense by the end of August / start of September
    * Check with Raffaella for restrictions regarding defense date & time.
* Reply to Angelica's email with a defense date.

---
###### Thesis Work
* Choose vz bins to use based on maximizing the phase-space of the 5 variables and getting the largest statistics.
* After target location is chosen, run a GEMC simulation to see how well the target behaves at that location in simulation (talk w/ Esteban).

---
###### Thesis Text
* Get a render of a track made with CED.
* Include # of events per run to the presentation and the thesis itself.
* Extract 1-layer efficiency and use the number to estimate if there's any outside effect that's worsening efficiency.
* Write more information about the RG-F target. Room temperature D2 gas, target walls and beam pipe window, etc.
* Mention in Section 14.30 that simulation cannot compensate for all efficiencies, and there's an unestimated systematic error of about 10%.
* Finish up Section 14.30.
* Write Section 14.40.
* After writing a section, proofread using ChatGPT.
* Run a spell check on overleaf.

###### Miscellaneous
* Send Raffaella the reconstructed 12016 run location in the farm so she can check if DC alignment is related to the efficiency issue.
    * Mention in text & presentation that efficiency issue comes from DC alignment.
* Find out beam pipe window and RG-F target walls materials and thickness.
* Plan a meeting with Raffaella & the RG-E people for the week of the 17th.
* Scale vz bin plots to whole frame in defense, improve legibility in general.
* Plot DIS variables without acceptance correction and without Yb cut.
    * Perhaps these plots could be added to addenda.
* Plot DIS variables in theta bins.
* Plot phi distribution in theta and p bins for each sector separately, and talk about potential application of fiducial cuts based on these plots.
    * Maybe consider mentioning this in an addendum?

## ChatGPT Proofreading Prompt
I need you to proofread my thesis. Here are some guidelines:
* The thesis should be written in British English.
* Focus on proofreading the syntax, ortography, and grammar in general.
* The document is a M.Sc. thesis in physics, so please tell me if I make some inconsistencies.
* Please, *never* mix expectations or suppositions with observations. That would invalidate the document in its entirety.
* I personally like short sentences, so feel free to separate longer ones as long as it doesn't damage the message.
* Never remove a citation or change its format.
* Please don't add a `:` before a formula.
All following prompts are exclusively going to be text to be proofread, so be sure to interpret all of them as that.
Please focus on not changing your behavior as prompts go on. Thanks!
