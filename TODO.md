## TODO
###### Milestones
* **07/17 - 07/19.** Define a 5 cm vz region to place the RG-E target based on maximizing phase-space and highest statistics.
* **07/20 - 07/27.** Simulate the RG-E target in the chosen region. Reconstruct and study behavior of DIS variables.
* **07/28 - 08/10.** *Weeks off due to marriage license.*
* **08/14.** Meet with Raffaella + RG-E group, show results so far.
* **08/14 - 08/21.** Apply feedback from Raffaella and group, work on thesis.
* **08/21.** Freeze thesis. Allow thesis committee time to correct mistakes and provide feedback.
* **08/21 - 09/11.** Apply feedback from committee and work on thesis defense presentation.
* **09/14.** Defend thesis.

###### Text
* Run a GEMC simulation to see how well the target behaves at the chosen location (-5 to 2 cm) in simulation -> Check with Esteban.
* Finish up Section 14.32 with simulation stuff.
* Write Section 14.40.
    * Mention in Section that simulation cannot compensate for all efficiencies, and there's an unestimated systematic error of about 10%.
* After writing a section, proofread using ChatGPT.
* Run a spell check on overleaf.

###### Defense
* Wait for Hayk to answer about milestones.
* Check with Raffaella for restrictions regarding defense date & time.
* Reply to Angelica's email with a defense date.
* Scale vz bin plots to whole frame, improve legibility in general.

###### Miscellaneous
* Plan a meeting with Raffaella & the RG-E people for the week of August 14th.
* *Get a render of a track made with CED?*
* Write more information about the RG-F target. Room temperature H2 or D2 gas, target walls and beam pipe window thicknesses, etc.

###### Addenda
* Plot DIS variables without acceptance correction and without Yb cut.
    * Perhaps these plots could be added to my thesis' addenda.
* Plot phi distribution in theta and p bins for each sector separately, and talk about potential application of fiducial cuts based on these plots.
    * Mention this in an addendum.
* Plot DIS variables in theta bins.

## ChatGPT Proofreading Prompt
I need you to proofread my thesis. Here are some guidelines:
* The thesis should be written in British English.
* Focus on proofreading the syntax, ortography, and grammar in general.
* The document is a M.Sc. thesis in physics, so please tell me if I make some inconsistencies.
* Please, *never* mix expectations or suppositions with observations. That would invalidate the document in its entirety.
* I personally like short sentences, so feel free to separate longer ones as long as it doesn't damage the message.
* Never remove a citation or change its format.
* Please don't add a `:` before a formula.
All following prompts are exclusively going to be text to be proofread, so be sure to interpret all of them as that.
Please focus on not changing your behavior as prompts go on. Thanks!
