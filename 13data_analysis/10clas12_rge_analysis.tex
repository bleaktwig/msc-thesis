\label{13.10::clas12_rge_analysis}
    To perform the acceptance analysis reported in this thesis, the author developed an extensive C/C++ program that runs on the ROOT library.
    The purpose of this program is not only to conduct the analysis described in this thesis but also to be used for RG-E analysis in general.
    The program and its source code are freely available under the GNU LGPLv3 license and can be accessed on GitHub at: \href{https://github.com/bleaktwig/clas12-rge-analysis}{github.com/bleaktwig/clas12-rge-analysis}.
    Issues and pull requests are welcomed, as they are crucial for maintaining the program and facilitating collaborative development in the repository.

    After compiling the program using \texttt{make}, five executables are obtained in the \texttt{bin} directory.
    The following sections provide a description of each executable.
