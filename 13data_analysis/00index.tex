\section{Data Analysis}
\label{13::data_analysis}
    The first section describes a C program developed by the author to perform the analysis in this thesis.
    The second section discusses the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) kinematics, which define the cuts made to the data.
    The third section provides detailed information about the approach used to include the sampling fraction in the analysis.
    Finally, the last section describes the simulations produced and the acceptance study conducted based on them.
