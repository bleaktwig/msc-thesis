\subsection{Cuts}
\label{13.20::cuts}
    In order to enhance the relevance of particles for the analysis presented in this work, three types of cuts are applied:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            General cuts:
            These cuts are designed to exclude poorly reconstructed particles.
        \item
            Geometry cuts:
            These cuts define the region from which the reconstruction data is considered valid and useful for the analysis.
        \item
            DIS cuts:
            These cuts narrow down the analysis region to focus specifically on DIS.
    \end{itemize}
    By applying these cuts, the analysis can be focused on particles that meet the criteria for good reconstruction, fall within the desired geometry range, and are relevant to the DIS process.
