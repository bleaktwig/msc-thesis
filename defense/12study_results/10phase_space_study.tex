\begin{frame}{Phase Space Study}
    \label{12.11::summary}

    To select the region where to place the target, a phase space study was conducted.

    \vspace{12pt}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            The RG-F target gas region (\ef{$-30 < v_z < 20$ cm}) was divided into ten 5 cm bins.

        \vspace{6pt}
        \item
            The phase space of each relevant kinematic variable (\ef{$Q^2$}, \ef{$\nu$}, \ef{$z_h$}, \ef{$p_T^2$}, \ef{$\phi_{PQ}$}) was analysed for each bin.

        \vspace{6pt}
        \item
            The goal of the study is to \ef{find a region that maximises the phase space for each}\appref{20.09::study_error_estimation}.
    \end{itemize}
