\begin{frame}{Conclusions}
    \label{12.31::conclusions}

    Multiple objectives were achieved in this thesis:

    \vspace{12pt}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            \ef{The ideal position for the RG-E target was found}.
            The selection was made to maximise the phase space of DIS variables and the experiment's statistics.

        \vspace{6pt}
        \item
            A standard software toolset was developed for RG-E analysis.

        \vspace{6pt}
        \item
            An FMT detector alignment software was developed.
            This resulted in a \ef{$40$ to $60\%$ increase in the $v_z$ resolution} of the CLAS12 FD.

        \vspace{6pt}
        \item
            The slow controls system that will move the RG-E target was developed.
    \end{itemize}
