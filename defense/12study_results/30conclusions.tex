    \label{12.31::conclusions}

    The work done in this thesis consists of three subjects:

    \vspace{12pt}

    An \ef{FMT detector alignment}.
    This resulted in
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            a \ef{$44.2\%$} increase in $e^-$ $v_z$ resolution for low luminosity (50 nA) runs, and

        \item
            a \ef{$59.1\%$} increase for production luminosity (250 nA) runs,
    \end{itemize}
    which allows for improved particle tracking.

    \vspace{12pt}

    The \ef{development of standard analysis software for RG-E}.
    Evidence of its efficacy are the results presented in the thesis and this presentation.

    \vspace{12pt}

    The \ef{selection of a position for the RG-E target}.
    The location chosen maximises the phase space of each studied DIS variable, in addition to maximising the statistics resulting from the experiment.
