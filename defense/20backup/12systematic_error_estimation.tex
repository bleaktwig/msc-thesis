% --+ 12.12 SYSTEMATIC ERROR ESTIMATION +---------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Systematic Error Estimation}
    \label{12.12::systematic_error_estimation}

    The lack of systematic errors in this thesis comes from the broadness of the study.

    \vspace{6pt}

    Based on previous CLAS and CLAS12 studies, a non-exhaustive list of relevant error sources would contain:

    \vspace{6pt}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            An uncertainty has been observed on previous CLAS deuterium targets.
            It averaged to \ef{$4.5\%$}, but \ef{depends on $\nu/E_b$}.

        \item
            We'd expect a low uncertainty for \ef{$e^-$ misidentification}, but a larger one for \ef{$\pi^\pm$}.

        \item
            There's an unestimated uncertainty from \ef{radiative effects}, but the \ef{$Y_b < 0.85$ cut} should mitigate them.

        \item
            Error from \ef{bin migration} was not considered, but could be studied from the \ef{LEPTO + GEMC simulations}.

        \item
            These simulations in turn carry unestimated uncertainties.

        \item
            The momentum correction from the \ef{sampling fraction} study carries a systematic error not considered.
    \end{itemize}
