\begin{frame}{Study Error Estimation}
    \label{20.09::study_error_estimation}

    The statistical error on the acceptance-corrected result \ef{$e_\text{corr}$} needs to consider two statistical errors: that of the measurements \ef{$e_\text{meas}$}, and that of acceptance correction \ef{$e_\text{acc}$}.

    \vspace{9pt}

    \ef{$e_\text{meas}$} is purely statistical and is given by
    \begin{equation*}
        e_\text{meas} = \frac{\delta y_\text{meas}}{y_\text{meas}},
    \end{equation*}

    \vspace{9pt}

    The acceptance correction error, \ef{$e_\text{acc}$}, was derived in Slide \textcolor{efd_purple}{\ref{20.05::acceptance_error_estimation}}.

    \vspace{9pt}

    Since \ef{$e_\text{meas}$} is experimental and $e_\text{acc}$ is from simulation, they are uncorrelated.
    Therefore, the \ef{total statistical error of the acceptance-corrected result} is the quadratic addition of the two errors, i.e.,
    \begin{equation*}
        e_\text{corr} = \sqrt{e_\text{meas}^2 + e_\text{acc}^2}.
    \end{equation*}
