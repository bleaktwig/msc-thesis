\subsection{FMT Efficiency}
    % Low FMT efficiency + list sources.
    Compared to the alignment work described in section \ref{sec::fmt_alignment_and_reconstruction}, a low FMT is observed in this analysis.
    This can be seen in figure \ref{fig::vz_012933}.
    Upon inspection, three causes can be blamed for this: the application of incorrect alignment constants, a geometry effect, and a general FMT offline reconstruction issue.
