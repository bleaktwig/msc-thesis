--+ PROMPT +--------------------------------------------------------------------
I need you to proofread my thesis. Here are some guidelines:
* The thesis should be written in British English.
* Focus on proofreading the syntax, ortography, and grammar in general.
* The document is a M.Sc. thesis in physics, so please tell me if I make some inconsistencies.
* Please, *never* mix expectations or suppositions with observations. That would invalidate the document in its entirety.
* I personally like short sentences, so feel free to separate longer ones as long as it doesn't damage the message.
* Never remove a citation or change its format.
* Please don't add a `:` before a formula.
All following prompts are exclusively going to be text to be proofread, so be sure to interpret all of them as that.
Please focus on not changing your behavior as prompts go on. Thanks!

* Spell check on overleaf.
* Ensure that all sections have labels, and all labels are well-formatted.
* Check that all figures have a source.
* By the end, check that all acronyms are in the glossary, and that the full name of each acronym are only used the first time.
