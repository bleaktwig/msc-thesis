\section{Experiment} \label{sec::experiment}
A particle accelerator is a machine that can accelerate charged particles to very high speeds.
It contains them in well-defined beams via an electromagnetic field, providing an environment in which controlled collisions can occur.
This is done so that we can study the small particles that result from these impacts~\cite{leduff2005longitudinal}.

Since a particle cannot reach the speed of light in a vacuum, it is more useful to measure its energy and momentum.
This is done in electronvolts (eV), which is the kinetic energy gained by a single electron accelerating from rest through an electric potential difference of one volt in vacuum~\cite{codata2015ev}.
For simplicity, it is usually measured in terms of MeV, GeV, TeV, etc.

As of the time of writing, two types of accelerators are mainly used to study particle physics:
Circular and linear accelerators (linacs).
The latter accelerate particles by attracting them onto charged plates, switching charge after the particles pass to repel them, pushing them to the next plate and repeating the process.
Linacs generally achieve lower momenta than their circular counterparts, but offer the advantage of a continuous stream of particles, thus achieving higher luminosity~\cite{pinchoff2005introduction}.
