\subsection{FMT Efficiency}
\label{14.10::fmt_efficiency}
    % Low FMT efficiency + list sources.
    Compared to the alignment work described in Section \ref{12::fmt_alignment_and_reconstruction}, a low FMT is observed in this analysis.
    This is evident in Figure \ref{fig::14.11::vz_seasons}.
    Upon inspection, three causes can be attributed to this: the application of incorrect alignment constants, a geometry effect, and a general FMT offline reconstruction issue.

    In this section, we extensively discussed the efficiency of the FMT detector, addressing alignment issues, as well as the impact of implementing a geometry cut.
    The key findings can be summarised as follows: despite applying corrections, the FMT efficiency for 3-layer tracks remained low, rendering them impractical for exclusive use.
    However, by switching to Spring 2020 data and applying the geometry cut, significant improvements were observed in the detection of trigger electrons and pions.
    Moreover, we thoroughly examined the correlation between efficiency and various variables, namely $v_z$, $\theta$, $\phi$, and $p$.
    The results were as anticipated: strong correlations were observed for $v_z$ and $\theta$, while no significant correlation was found for $\phi$ or $p$.
    These findings provide valuable insights into the performance and limitations of FMT, paving the way for an acceptance correction study and the following work.
