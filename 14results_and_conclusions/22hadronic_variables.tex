    Next, we'll look at $z_h$, $P_T^2$, and $\phi_{PQ}$ acceptances for $\pi^+$ and $\pi^-$.
    We can see $z_h$ acceptance in Figure \textbf{TODO}, where... (TODO).

    Next, $P_T^2$ acceptance is presented in Figure \textbf{TODO}, where we see that... (TODO).

    Finally, $\phi_{PQ}$ acceptance is studied in Figure \textbf{TODO}.
    Here, we see... (TODO).
