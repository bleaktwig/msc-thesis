\subsubsection{Reconstruction Effect}
\label{14.13::reconstruction_effect}
    Even after correcting for both the alignment and geometry issues, the FMT still exhibits lower efficiency compared to what was observed during alignment (compare Figure \ref{fig::14.12::vz_012016_geomcut} with Figure \ref{fig::12.43::dc_vs_fmt_vz_11983_corrected}).
    After conducting a thorough study, it was determined that this effect is not correlated with the run number, beam energy, or beam luminosity.
    Consequently, it can be concluded that the issue is not caused by hardware problems or run conditions.

    Based on these findings, the logical conclusion is that the effect stems from a general issue in the FMT offline reconstruction for data.
    Identifying and rectifying this issue would require a larger project beyond the scope of this thesis and is therefore left as future work.
    For the purposes of this analysis, we will rely on a large number of events to minimize any statistical deficiencies.
