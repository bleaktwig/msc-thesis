\subsubsection{Reconstruction Effect}
\label{14.13::reconstruction_effect}
    Even after correcting for both the alignment and geometry issues, FMT still has a lower efficiency when compared to that found during alignment (compare figures \ref{fig::14.12::vz_012016_geomcut} with \ref{fig::12.43::dc_vs_fmt_vz_11983_corrected}).
    After some study, the effect was found not to be correlated to run number, beam energy, or beam luminosity.
    Based on this, we can discard it being caused by hardware issues or run conditions.

    Based on this, the logical conclusion is that the effect comes from a general issue in FMT offline reconstruction.
    Finding and fixing this would be a larger project than what's contemplated in the scope of this thesis, so it's left as future work.
    For the purposes of this analysis, we'll contempt ourselves with using a large number of events, minimising statistic deficiencies.
