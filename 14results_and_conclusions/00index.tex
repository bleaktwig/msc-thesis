    The FMT efficiency is discussed in the first section, including a brief study of it.
    Then, the second section delves into the acceptance correction results, based on the methodology described in section \ref{13.40::acceptance_correction}.
    Following that, the study results are discussed in detail, and the conclusions of the study follow shortly thereafter.
