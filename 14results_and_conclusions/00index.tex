\section{Results and Conclusions}
\label{14::results_and_conclusions}
    The FMT efficiency is discussed in the first section, including a brief study of it.
    Then, the second section delves into the acceptance correction results, based on the methodology described in Section \ref{13.40::acceptance_correction}.
    Following that, the study results are discussed in detail, and the conclusions of the study follow shortly thereafter.

    % Run configuration.
    All Figures in this section that show results for data are from RG-F run 12016.
    For this run, a gas H2 target was used.
    The beam energy was set to $10.4$ GeV, and the luminosity to $250$ nA.
    The solenoid field was set to a polarity of $-0.745033$, and the torus to inbending polarity of $-1$.
    The run has a total of $10,046,225$ events.
