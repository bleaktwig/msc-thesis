\subsubsection{Efficiency Study}
\label{14.14::efficiency_study}
% --+ Integrated. +-------------------------------------------------------------
    With all these effects accounted for, we can proceed to study the efficiency in detail.
    First, if we define FMT efficiency as the percentage of DC tracks that get accepted by FMT, we get the results in Table \ref{tab::14.14::fmt_efficiency_study} for runs 12933 (Summer 2020) and 12016 (Spring 2020).

        \caption{Results of the FMT efficiency study performed.}
        \label{tab::14.14::fmt_efficiency_study}
    \end{table}

    Integrating all variables, it becomes evident that even with the corrections, the pion efficiency for 3-layer tracks does not exceed $3\%$.
    Consequently, it is not practical to work exclusively with FMT tracks that traverse all three FMT layers.
    For the remainder of the document, tracks detected by 2 or 3 layers will be collectively referred to as FMT tracks.

    The table illustrates the positive impact of switching to Spring 2020 data and applying the geometry cut.
    The switch results in a $30.1\%$ increase in detected trigger electrons, as well as a $70.8\%$ increase for positive pions and a $58.9\%$ increase for negative pions.
    Furthermore, by applying the geometry cut based on $v_z$ and $\theta$, an additional $64.2\%$ increase in trigger electrons is achieved, resulting in a total increase of $113.9\%$.
    The pion yield experiences a substantial enhancement, with positive pions increasing by $150.2\%$ and negative pions increasing by $231.5\%$, resulting in a total increase of $330.8\%$ and $426.8\%$, respectively.

% --+ Separated. +--------------------------------------------------------------
    Next, we need to ensure that we are not introducing a systematic error by applying these corrections.
    To achieve this, we must investigate the effect of the geometry cut on different detected variables for electrons ($e^-$), positive pions ($\pi^+$), and negative pions ($\pi^-$).
    Based on the definition of the cut, we anticipate a strong correlation between efficiency and $v_z$ and $\theta$, and at most a weak correlation with $\phi$ and $p$.

    Our prediction is validated by Figures \ref{fig::14.14::fmt_efficiency_vz} and \ref{fig::14.14::fmt_efficiency_theta}.
    The efficiency displays a pronounced dependence on both $v_z$ and $\theta$ for all three particles under study.
    It is worth noting that the dependence is more pronounced for electrons compared to pions.
    This outcome aligns with expectations, as the only accepted pions are those detected in events where an electron is also detected.
    Thus, the ``final'' pion efficiency incorporates the combined detector efficiencies for electrons and pions.

    Next, we examine the $\phi$ efficiency, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig::14.14::fmt_efficiency_phi}.
    Our prediction holds true for both positive and negative pions, as the efficiency demonstrates no dependence on the value of $\phi$.
    However, in the case of electrons, upon initial inspection, the sharp valleys appear less prominent after applying the geometry cut.

    Nevertheless, this is merely a visual effect.
    When we tally the number of electrons detected by the DC and FMT, the valleys become more pronounced in the DC, while they remain the same in the FMT.
    Consequently, the increase in FMT efficiency becomes more pronounced in these valleys, as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig::14.14::phi_geomcut}.

    Finally, Figure \ref{fig::14.14::fmt_efficiency_p} confirms our expectation that there is no strong correlation between efficiency and momentum.
