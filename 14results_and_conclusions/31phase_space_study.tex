\subsubsection{Phase Space Study}
\label{14.31::phase_space_study}
    Based on the objectives of this DIS study, it is favourable to maximise the phase space of each DIS variable.
    Overall, this broadens the scope of investigation, increases sensitivity, and facilitates the testing of theoretical predictions for future studies using the double target system.
    Due to this, our first criterium for selecting a $v_z$ region for the target is to find a region that gives us the maximum range of kinematic variables.

    % Resulting plots.
    Each of the acceptance corrected DIS variables can be seen separated in $v_z$ bins in Figures \ref{fig::14.31::q2_vz} to \ref{fig::14.31::phipq_-211_vz}.
    The electron variables distributions, $Q^2$ and $\nu$, can be seen in Figures \ref{fig::14.31::q2_vz} and \ref{fig::14.31::nu_vz} respectively.
    Then, $z_h$ can be observed in Figures \ref{fig::14.31::zh_211_vz} for $e^-\pi^+$, and in \ref{fig::14.31::zh_-211_vz} for $e^-\pi^-$.
    $p_T^2$ for $e^-\pi^+$ can be seen in Figure \ref{fig::14.31::pt2_211_vz}, and for $e^-\pi^-$ in Figure \ref{fig::14.31::pt2_-211_vz}.
    At last, the $\phi_{PQ}$ distributions for $e^-\pi^+$ can be observed in Figure \ref{fig::14.31::phipq_211_vz}, while for $e^-\pi^-$ in Figure \ref{fig::14.31::phipq_-211_vz}.


    % Q2.
    \paragraph{$Q^2$ Study}
        First, we look at the study results for the electron variable $Q^2$.
        As can be seen in Figure \ref{fig::14.31::q2_vz}, the higher end of the variable's phase space is limited for $v_z < -5$ cm, with the effect becoming more pronounced the further upstream we go.
        This effect can be understood by compounding the $\theta$ efficiency for negative particles (see Figure \ref{fig::14.21::theta_study_neg}) and the limited acceptance region of FMT given by Equation \eqref{eq::12.42::fmt_geometry_cut} (see Figure \ref{eq::12.42::vz_vs_theta}): the higher end of $\theta$ becomes limited for lower $v_z$ values.

        With the stated objective of maximising the phase space of each variable, this draws us to set the minimum $v_z$ for the RG-E target near $-5$ cm.
        Furthermore, we also note that the variable behaves oddly for $10$ cm $< v_z < 20$ cm, following an uncharacteristic shape.
        This is likely related to the cut in low $\theta$ angles for that region, again due to the acceptance region of FMT.

    % nu.
    \paragraph{$\nu$ Study}
        We can then look at the results for $\nu$, seen in Figure \ref{fig::14.31::nu_vz}.
        As was observed in Section \ref{14.20::acceptance_correction_results}, $\nu$ has no direct correlation with the $\theta_C$ angle.
        Due to this, we see no strong effect on the variable's phase space for $v_z < -5$ cm, unlike $Q^2$'s.
        However, we do see a loss on the lower end of the phase space at $v_z = 10$ cm and downstream.
        Based on this effect, it's reasonable to keep $v_z$ below around $10$ cm if we want to conserve $\nu$'s phase space as large as possible.

    % zh.
    \paragraph{$z_h$ Study}
        Despite $z_h$ lack of direct correlation with $\theta$, there's a clear difference accross the different $v_z$ bins, as can be seen in Figures \ref{fig::14.31::zh_211_vz} and \ref{fig::14.31::zh_-211_vz}.
        This however can be explained due to its correlation to $\nu$, as the variables are inversely proportional (see Equation \eqref{eq::10.32::zh}).
        Just as with $\nu$, the phase space loss is only extreme for $v_z > 10$ cm, and as such, it doesn't impose more severe restrictions on $v_z$ than what we already had defined based on our $Q^2$ and $\nu$ studies.

    % pt2.
    \paragraph{$p_T^2$ Study}
        First of all, we note that in both Figures \ref{fig::14.31::pt2_211_vz} and \ref{fig::14.31::pt2_-211_vz} there are large statistical noises for $p_T^2 > 1.4 \text{GeV}^2$, just as was predicted in Section \ref{14.22::hadronic_variables}.
        Studying the variable's phase space, we observe a cutoff at high $p_T^2$ values for $v_z < -5$ cm and $v_z > 15$ cm, similar to what was seen for $Q^2$.
        Based on this, no new restrictions are imposed on the $v_z$ region in study.

    % phipq.
    \paragraph{$\phi_{PQ}$ Study}
        Observing Figures \ref{fig::14.31::phipq_211_vz} and \ref{fig::14.31::phipq_-211_vz}, no easily discernible loss is observed in the phase space of $\phi_{PQ}$ as we move along $v_z$.
        There are significant changes in the shape of the variable distribution for different $v_z$ bins, but a shape study goes beyond the scope of this thesis, as we are already provided with plenty information from the other DIS variables.
