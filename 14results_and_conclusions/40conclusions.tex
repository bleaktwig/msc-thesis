\subsection{Conclusions}
    \label{14.40::conclusions}
    This thesis consisted of three subjects: the alignment of the FMT detector, the development of a standard analysis software for RG-E, and the selection of a location for the RG-E target.

    % TODO.

% --+ FMT Alignment +-----------------------------------------------------------
    About FMT alignment, we developed the standard FMT alignment software which works by minimising the track residuals.
    We also developed certain modifications to the FMT reconstruction software to integrate the alignment.
    This work resulted in an $e^-$ $z$ resolution of $\sigma_\text{FMT} = 0.387$ cm for low luminosity ($50$ nA) runs, and one of $\sigma_\text{FMT} = 0.596$ cm for high luminosity ($250$ nA) runs.
    A detail rundown of the subject can be read in Section \ref{12::fmt_alignment_and_reconstruction}.

% --+ Analysis Software +-------------------------------------------------------
    Regarding the standard analysis software, the entire toolset was developed as part of the work related to this thesis.
    The software works as expected.
    As evidence of this, all the analysis done in Sections \ref{13.30::sampling_fraction}, \ref{13.40::acceptance_correction}, and \ref{14::results_and_conclusions} was made using this same software.
    Most of the Figures presented on this thesis were obtained using this software, as is shown on their sources.
    Additionally, other preparatory analyses for the RG-E experiment have used the software to obtain their results.
    The software itself is explained in Section \ref{13.10::clas12_rge_analysis}.

% --+ Target Location +---------------------------------------------------------
    Using the software just described, we selected the best location for the RG-E target based on phase space and statistics studies.
    For the phase space study, the range of two electron variables -- $Q^2$ and $\nu$ -- and three hadronic variables -- $z_h$, $p_T^2$, and $\phi_{PQ}$ -- was studied for ten 5 cm bins in $v_z$.
    A range from $-5$ to $10$ cm was obtained from this study, based on maximising the phase spaces.
    Then, for the statistic study, a 7 cm region was picked in this range based on maximising the number of events.
    The region chosen was from $-5$ to $2$ cm.
    A validation of the region was then made by running a simulation of the RG-E target placed in it.
    This analysis is detailed in Section \ref{14.30::study_results}.

% --+ Unestimated Systematic Errors +-------------------------------------------
    % TODO. Mention issue of large systematic errors (~10%) not considered in the work.

% --+ Future Plans +------------------------------------------------------------
    % TODO. Publish something to help other run groups in the future.
