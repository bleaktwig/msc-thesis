\subsubsection{Electron Variables}
\label{14.21::electron_variables}
    DC and FMT acceptances were obtained by following the procedure described in Section \ref{13.13::acceptance_correction}.
    First, we'll study the $Q^2$ and $\nu$ acceptances for the scattered $e^-$.
    $Q^2$ and $\nu$ acceptances are presented in Figures \textbf{TODO} and \textbf{TODO}, respectively.
    Each one is presented in integrated kinematical region for the other variable.

    % TODO. Talk about resulting plots, check if everything is as expected.
