\subsection{Acceptance Correction Results}
\label{14.20::acceptance_correction_results}
    DC and FMT acceptances were obtained by following the procedure described in Section \ref{13.13::acc_corr}.
    In this section, we will study the acceptance percentage for each electron and hadronic variable.
    These numbers represent the percentage of thrown particles that were detected by the DC and by 2 or 3 FMT layers in addition to DC in the GEMC simulation.

    Since they represent the acceptance percentage, all plots display a calculated division as follows
    \begin{equation}
        y_\text{acc} = \frac{y_r}{y_t},
        \label{eq::14.20::acc}
    \end{equation}
    where $y_\text{acc}$ is the percentage of accepted particles, $y_r$ is the number of reconstructed particles by the studied detector in the GEMC simulation, and $y_t$ is the number of particles thrown by LEPTO.

    Then, to propagate the error of $y_r$ ($e_d$) and $y_t$ ($e_t$) to $y_\text{acc}$ ($e_\text{acc}$), we have
    \begin{align}
        e_\text{acc} &= \delta \left(\frac{y_r}{y_t}\right)
        \nonumber \\
        &= y_\text{acc} \cdot \sqrt{
            \left( \frac{e_r}{y_r} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{e_t}{y_t} \right)^2
        },
        \nonumber
        \intertext{since $y_t$ is the number of trials, we can assume $e_t = 0$, and thus}
        &= y_\text{acc} \cdot \frac{e_r}{y_r}.
        \label{eq::14.20::acc_error_estimation}
    \end{align}

    From the Central Limit Theorem, assuming a normal distribution, the variance $e_r^2$ is given by
    \begin{equation*}
        e_r^2 = y_t \cdot y_\text{acc} (1 - y_\text{acc}).
    \end{equation*}

    Replacing this in Equation \eqref{eq::14.20::acc_error_estimation}, we obtain
    \begin{equation*}
        e_\text{acc} = y_\text{acc} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{y_t y_\text{acc}(1 - y_\text{acc})}}{y_r}.
    \end{equation*}

    Now, replacing $y_\text{acc}$ with its definition from Equation \eqref{eq::14.20::acc}, we arrive at the final error expression
    \begin{equation}
        e_\text{acc} = \sqrt{\frac{y_\text{acc}(1-y_\text{acc})}{y_t}}.
        \label{eq::14.20::acc_error}
    \end{equation}
