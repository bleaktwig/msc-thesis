\subsection{Acceptance Correction Results}
\label{14.20::acceptance_correction_results}
    DC and FMT acceptances were obtained by following the procedure described in Section \ref{13.13::acc_corr}.
    In this section, we'll study the acceptance percentage for each electron and hadronic variable.
    These numbers are defined as the percentage of thrown particles that were accepted by DC, 2 FMT layers, and 3 FMT layers in the \texttt{gemc} simulation.
