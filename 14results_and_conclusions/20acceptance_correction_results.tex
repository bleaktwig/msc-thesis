\subsection{Acceptance Correction Results}
\label{14.20::acceptance_correction_results}
    % TODO. Remove FMT3 tracks from here onward.
    DC and FMT acceptances were obtained by following the procedure described in Section \ref{13.13::acc_corr}.
    In this section, we'll study the acceptance percentage for each electron and hadronic variable.
    These numbers represent the percentage of thrown particles that were detected by the DC, 2 FMT layers, and 3 FMT layers in the \texttt{gemc} simulation.

    Since they represent the acceptance percentage, all plots display a calculated division as follows
    \begin{equation}
        y_\text{acc} = \frac{y_d}{y_t},
        \label{eq::14.20::acc}
    \end{equation}
    where $y_\text{acc}$ is the percentage of accepted particles, $y_d$ is the number of detected particles by the studied detector, and $y_t$ is the number of particles thrown by LEPTO.

    Then, to propagate the error of $y_d$ ($e_d$) and $y_t$ ($e_t$) to $y_\text{acc}$ ($e_\text{acc}$), we get
    \begin{align}
        e_\text{acc} &= \delta \left(\frac{y_r}{y_t}\right)
        \nonumber \\
        &= y_\text{acc} \cdot \sqrt{
            \left( \frac{e_r}{y_r} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{e_t}{y_t} \right)^2
        },
        \nonumber
        \intertext{since $y_t$ is the number of trials, we can assume $e_t = 0$, and thus}
        &= y_\text{acc} \cdot \frac{e_r}{y_r}.
        \label{eq::14.20::acc_error_estimation}
    \end{align}

    From the Central Limit Theorem it can be proven that, assuming a normal distribution, the variance $e_r^2$ is
    \begin{equation*}
        e_r^2 = y_t \cdot y_\text{acc} (1 - y_\text{acc}),
    \end{equation*}
    which, replaced in Equation \eqref{eq::14.20::acc_error_estimation}, yields
    \begin{equation*}
        e_\text{acc} = y_\text{acc} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{y_t y_\text{acc}(1 - y_\text{acc})}}{y_r}.
    \end{equation*}

    Replacing $y_\text{acc}$ here by its definition in Equation \eqref{eq::14.20::acc} gives us a final error of
    \begin{equation}
        e_\text{acc} = \sqrt{\frac{y_\text{acc}(1-y_\text{acc})}{y_t}}.
        \label{eq::14.20::acc_error}
    \end{equation}
