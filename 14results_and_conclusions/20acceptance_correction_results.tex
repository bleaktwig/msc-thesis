\subsection{Acceptance Correction Results}
\label{14.20::acceptance_correction_results}
    % TODO. Remove FMT3 tracks from here onward.
    DC and FMT acceptances were obtained by following the procedure described in Section \ref{13.13::acc_corr}.
    In this section, we'll study the acceptance percentage for each electron and hadronic variable.
    These numbers represent the percentage of thrown particles that were detected by the DC, 2 FMT layers, and 3 FMT layers in the \texttt{gemc} simulation.

    Since they represent the acceptance percentage, all plots display a calculated division as follows
    \begin{equation*}
        y_\text{acc} = \frac{y_d}{y_t},
    \end{equation*}
    where $y_\text{acc}$ is the percentage of accepted particles, $y_d$ is the number of detected particles by the studied detector, and $y_t$ is the number of particles thrown by LEPTO.
    To propagate the error of $y_d$ ($e_d$) and $y_t$ ($e_t$) to $y_\text{acc}$ ($e_\text{acc}$), the following procedure is followed
    \begin{equation}
        e_\text{acc} = \frac{y_d}{y_t} \cdot \sqrt{
            \left(\frac{e_t - e_d}{e_t\cdot e_d}\right)
        }
        \label{eq::14.20::acc_error}
    \end{equation}
    % NOTE. If I have the time, it would be a good idea to explain how to obtain these errors (count detected and non-detected particles).
