\subsection{Acceptance Correction Results}
\label{14.20::acceptance_correction_results}
    DC and FMT acceptances were obtained by following the procedure described in Section \ref{13.13::acc_corr}.
    In this section, we'll study the acceptance percentage for each electron and hadronic variable.
    These numbers represent the percentage of thrown particles that were detected by the DC, 2 FMT layers, and 3 FMT layers in the \texttt{gemc} simulation.

    Since they represent the acceptance percentage, all plots display a calculated division as follows
    \begin{equation*}
        y_\text{acc} = \frac{y_d}{y_t},
    \end{equation*}
    where $y_\text{acc}$ is the percentage of accepted particles, $y_d$ is the number of detected particles by the studied detector, and $y_t$ is the number of particles thrown by LEPTO.
    To propagate the error of $y_d$ ($e_d$) and $y_t$ ($e_t$) to $y_\text{acc}$ ($e_\text{acc}$), the following procedure is followed
    \begin{align}
        \nonumber e_\text{acc}^2 &=
            \left(\frac{dy_\text{acc}}{dy_d}\right)^2 \cdot e_d^2 +
            \left(\frac{dy_\text{acc}}{dy_t}\right)^2 \cdot e_t^2
            \\
        \nonumber e_\text{acc}^2 &=
            \left(\frac{1}{y_t}\right)^2 \cdot e_d^2 +
            \left(-\frac{y_d}{y_t^2}\right) \cdot e_t^2
            \\
        \nonumber e_\text{acc}^2 &=
            \frac{e_d^2}{y_t^2} + \frac{y_d^2 e_t^2}{y_t^4}
            \\
        \nonumber e_\text{acc}^2 &=
            \frac{y_d^2}{y_t^2} \cdot \left[
                \frac{e_d^2}{y_d^2} + \frac{e_t^2}{y_t^2}
            \right]
            \\
        e_\text{acc} &=
            \frac{y_d}{y_t} \cdot \sqrt{
                \left(\frac{e_d}{y_d}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{e_t}{y_t}\right)^2
            }
        \label{eq::14.20::acc_error}
    \end{align}
