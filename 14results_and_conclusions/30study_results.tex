    % Explain binning scheme selected.
    To select a region in $v_z$ to place the RG-E target, two criteria were considered: a phase space study and a statistics study.
    In the phase space study, the RG-F target gas region ($-30 < v_z < 20$ cm) was divided into ten 5 cm bins, and the phase space of each kinematic variable was analysed in each bin.
    The results of this study are presented in Section \ref{14.31::phase_space_study}.
    For the statistics study, the region chosen in the phase space study was further divided into 1 cm bins.
    The study aimed to determine which 7 cm region within the chosen range had the largest statistics.
    The results of this study are presented in Section \ref{14.32::statistics_study}.
    % The validity of this choice was evaluated using a gemc simulation of the RG-E target system.

    % Statistical error estimation.
    The total statistical error on the acceptance-corrected result, denoted as $e_\text{corr}$, needs to consider both the statistical error of the measurements ($e_\text{meas}$) and the acceptance correction ($e_\text{acc}$).
    The error of the measurements, $e_\text{meas}$, is purely statistical in nature and is given by
    \begin{equation*}
        e_\text{meas} = \frac{\delta y_\text{meas}}{y_\text{meas}},
    \end{equation*}
    The acceptance correction error, $e_\text{acc}$, was derived in Equation \eqref{eq::14.20::acc_error}.

    Since $e_\text{meas}$ arises purely from experimental data and $e_\text{acc}$ is purely from simulation, they are considered to be completely uncorrelated.
    Therefore, the total statistical error of the acceptance-corrected result can be estimated as the quadratic addition of the two errors, i.e.,
    \begin{equation*}
        e_\text{corr} = \sqrt{e_\text{meas}^2 + e_\text{acc}^2}.
    \end{equation*}
