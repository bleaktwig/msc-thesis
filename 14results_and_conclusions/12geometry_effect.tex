\subsubsection{Geometry Effect}
\label{sssec::geometry_effect}
    % The effect has already been presented and discussed before, so we're brief.
    This problem is already discussed in detail in section \ref{sssec::geometry_effect}.
    As a quick reminder, FMT sits at $z \approx 26$ cm, and it naturally performs poorly for targets to close to it.
    We can measure the strength of this effect by applying the geometry cut given by equation \eqref{eq::fmt_geometry_cut} to both DC and FMT tracks.
    Figure \ref{fig::vz_012016_geomcut} the effect of the cut when applied on figure \ref{fig::vz_012016}.
    Its effect on a $v_z$ vs $\theta$ plot can be seen on figure \ref{fig::vz_vs_theta}.

    Based on this cut and the FMT $z$ position, subsequent plots will be constrained to the range $-30 \text{[cm]} < v_z < 20 \text{[cm]}$.
