\subsubsection{Geometry Effect}
\label{14.12::geometry_effect}
    % The effect has already been presented and discussed before, so we're brief.
    This problem has already been extensively discussed in section \ref{12.42::geometry_effect}.
    In summary, the FMT detector is located at approximately $z \approx 26$ cm, and it exhibits poor performance for targets located too close to it.
    The strength of this effect can be quantified by applying the geometry cut described by Equation \eqref{eq::12.42::fmt_geometry_cut} to both the DC and FMT tracks.
    Figure \ref{fig::14.12::vz_012016_geomcut} illustrates the impact of this cut on both the DC and FMT tracks when applied to figure \ref{fig::14.11::vz_012016}.
    The effect of the cut on a $v_z$ vs $\theta$ plot can be observed in Figure \ref{eq::12.42::vz_vs_theta}.

    Based on this cut and the FMT's position along the $z$-axis, subsequent plots will be confined to the range $-30 \text{cm} < v_z < 20 \text{cm}$.

        The effect is very clear on DC tracks, yet it almost doesn't affect FMT tracks.
