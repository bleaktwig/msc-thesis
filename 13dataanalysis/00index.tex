\section{Data Analysis} \label{sec::dataanalysis}
    The first section on this chapter describes a C program developed by the author to perform the analysis in this thesis.
    Then, the second section talks about the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) kinematics which define the cuts made to the data.
    The third section goes into detail about the simulations produced for the analysis.
    Finally, the last section describes the acceptance study made based on these simulations.
