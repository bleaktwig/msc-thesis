\subsection{\texttt{clas12-rge-analysis}} \label{ssec::clas12rgeanalysis}
    To perform the acceptance analysis reported in this thesis, the author developed an extensive C/C++ program running over the ROOT library.
    The purpose of this program is not only to do this analysis, but to be used in general in RG-E analysis.
    The program and its source are freely available under the GNU LGPLv3 license, and can be seen on GitHub at \hyperlink{https://github.com/bleaktwig/clas12-rge-analysis}{https://github.com/bleaktwig/clas12-rge-analysis}.
    Issues and pull requests are welcome, and are a crucial part to enable maintainability and collaborative development to the repository.

    After compiling the program via \texttt{make}, five executables are obtained in the \texttt{bin} directory.
    The following sections describe each.
