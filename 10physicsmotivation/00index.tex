% Classical particle physics: From Democritus to Chadwick.
    Since ancient times, humanity has pondered about the composition of matter.
    Philosophers from both east and west have often contemplated the question, and the modern view of this composition is based on the notional atom.
    This atom, or indivisible particle, was proposed by Democritus on the sixth century B.C.
    Despite its uncanny similarity to the modern notion of the atom, the model remained only an abstract idea for more than two millennia.

    On the grand scheme of things, only recently we've been able to probe into the structure of matter and thus, see the atom.
    In 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered the ``corpuscles'', or electrons, using a cathode ray tube.
    Based on this discovery, he proposed an atomic model based on a paste of positive charges, which had much lighter electrons floating inside.
    Then, in 1909, Ernest Rutherford put this model to the test in what became the first scattering experiment in history.
    By bombarding $\alpha$ particles on a thin gold foil, he proved that most of the atom's mass was concentrated in a small, positively charged nucleus at its center.
    He named the constituents of this nucleus protons.

    Following that, Niels Bohr proposed the atomic planetary model in 1914.
    His theory fits precisely with the experimental data for Hydrogen, but doesn't apply for heavier atoms.
    This was solved with the discovery of the neutron in 1932 by James Chadwick.
    This made the mass of atoms consistent to available experimental data.
    This discovery marks the end of the era of classical particle physics.

% The standard model.
    Then, in the 50s and 60s, a bewildering variety of particles was found in scattering experiments.
    Theory born from this ``particle zoo'' produced the Standard Model, which explains these particles as a combination of a small number of fundamental particles.
    The model describes three of the four fundamental forces using force-mediating gauge bosons.
    It additionally describes 24 particles, the constituents of matter.
    Finally, it also includes one scalar boson, the Higgs boson, whose existence was proven in 2012 \cite{aad2012}.

    Half of these 24 particles are the elementary constituents of hadrons.
    First referred to as quarks by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig and later as partons by Richard Feynman, they are point-like spin-1/2 particles with a fraction of an electron's electric charge, and are distinguished by ``flavors''.
    Both Gell-Mann and Zweig's constituent quark model and Feynman's parton model were later merged into the Quark-Parton model \cite{perkins2000}.

% How to study particle physics and DIS.
    Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) is the process used to probe the interior of hadrons using leptons.
    The process is similar to Rutherford scattering, and provided the first experimental evidence of quarks.
    DIS can be used to probe ever deeper into the structure of matter by using ever higher energies, thanks to Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

    High energy probes lead to asymptotic freedom, which is the property in which the interactions between particles, such as quarks, become arbitrarily weak at shorter distances.
    It implies that, inside hadrons, quarks move mostly as free, non-interacting particles.
    This allows reliable calculation of event cross sections in particle physics.

% Quantum Chromodynamics.
    Another relevant feature is colour confinement, which is the property of colour-charged in which they cannot be isolated.
    Colour charge is the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) analogy of electric charge.
    There are three colour charges and their corresponding anticharges.
    Quarks have one colour while gluons, the force-mediators of the strong force, have bi-colour charge.
    In equilibrium, quarks are confined to be near each other by this force to form quark-antiquark pairs or 3-quark triplets, such that the net colour charge is neutral.

    QCD describes these properties, thus modelling the strong interaction between quarks.
    Similar to the electromagnetic force, the strength of the interaction is given by the strong coupling constant \textalpha.
    Unlike it, however, this constant is weaker at decreasing distances.

% What is this experiment.
    At a larger distance scale, or lower resolution, confinement is expected to be visible.
    \textalpha increases to values close to 1, and the perturbative treatment of QCD is not possible.
    Not much is known about the non-perturbative behaviour of QCD, and thus so far it is mostly based on phenomenological models.
    The purpose of the RG-E experiment is to collect new data on the hadronic structure in Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS).
    With this, we hope to further understand quark propagation and hadron formation.
