% --+ Classical particle physics +----------------------------------------------
    Since ancient times, humanity has pondered the composition of matter.
    Philosophers from both East and West have often contemplated this question, and the modern view of this composition is based on the concept of the atom.
    The notion of the atom, or indivisible particle, was proposed by Democritus in the 6th century B.C.
    Despite its uncanny similarity to the modern concept of the atom, the model remained an abstract idea for more than two millennia.

    In the grand scheme of things, it is only recently that we have been able to probe into the structure of matter and observe the atom.
    In 1897, J.J. Thomson discovered "corpuscles," or electrons, using a cathode ray tube.
    Based on this discovery, he proposed an atomic model consisting of a positively charged paste with lighter electrons floating inside.
    Then, in 1909, Ernest Rutherford put this model to the test in what became the first scattering experiment in history.
    By bombarding \textalpha particles onto a thin gold foil, he proved that most of the atom's mass was concentrated in a small, positively charged nucleus at its center.
    He named the constituents of this nucleus protons.

    Following that, Niels Bohr proposed the atomic planetary model in 1914.
    His theory precisely fit the experimental data for Hydrogen but did not apply to heavier atoms.
    This issue was resolved with the discovery of the neutron in 1932 by James Chadwick.
    This discovery made the masses of atoms consistent with available experimental data, marking the end of the era of classical particle physics.

% --+ The standard model +------------------------------------------------------
    Then, in the 1950s and 1960s, a bewildering variety of particles were found in scattering experiments.
    The theory born from this ``particle zoo'' gave rise to the Standard Model, which explains these particles as combinations of a small number of fundamental particles.
    The model describes three of the four fundamental forces using force-mediating gauge bosons.
    Additionally, it describes 24 particles, which are the constituents of matter.
    Finally, it also includes one scalar boson, the Higgs boson, whose existence was proven in 2012 \cite{aad2012}.

    Half of these 24 particles are elementary constituents of hadrons.
    They were initially referred to as quarks by Murray Gell-Mann and George Zweig, and later as partons by Richard Feynman.
    Quarks are point-like spin-1/2 particles with a fraction of an electron's electric charge, and they are distinguished by "flavors".
    Both Gell-Mann and Zweig's constituent quark model and Feynman's parton model were later merged into the Quark-Parton model \cite{perkins2000}.

% --+ How to study particle physics and DIS +-----------------------------------
    Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS) is the process used to investigate the interior of hadrons using leptons.
    The process is similar to Rutherford scattering and provided the first experimental evidence of quarks.
    DIS can be employed to delve even deeper into the structure of matter by utilising increasingly higher energies, thanks to Werner Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.

    High-energy probes lead to asymptotic freedom, which is the property where the interactions between particles, such as quarks, become increasingly weak at shorter distances.
    This implies that inside hadrons, quarks mostly move as free, non-interacting particles.
    This allows for reliable calculation of event cross-sections in particle physics.

% --+ Quantum Chromodynamics +--------------------------------------------------
    Another important feature is colour confinement, which is the property of colour-charged particles that prevents their isolation.
    Colour charge is the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) equivalent of electric charge.
    There are three colour charges and their corresponding anticharges.
    Quarks possess a single colour charge, while gluons, the force-mediators of the strong force, have a bi-colour charge.
    In a state of equilibrium, the strong force confines quarks to be in close proximity, forming quark-antiquark pairs or 3-quark triplets in such a way that the net colour charge is neutral.

    QCD describes these properties and models the strong interaction between quarks.
    Similar to the electromagnetic force, the strength of the interaction is determined by the strong coupling constant \textalpha.
    However, unlike the electromagnetic force, this constant weakens as distances decrease.

% --+ What is this experiment +-------------------------------------------------
    At a larger distance scale, or smaller resolution, confinement is expected to become visible.
    The \textalpha value increases to values close to 1, and the perturbative treatment of QCD is not viable.
    There is limited knowledge about the non-perturbative behaviour of QCD, and therefore, it mostly relies on phenomenological models at present.
    The aim of the RG-E experiment is to gather new data on the hadronic structure in Semi-Inclusive Deep Inelastic Scattering (SIDIS).
    Through this experiment, we hope to gain further insight into quark propagation and hadron formation.
